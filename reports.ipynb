    "This report summarizes the results of six experiments performed on the MViT_V1_B model. Each experiment focuses on the impact of different configurations, including optimizer selection, dropout rates, number of unfreezed layers, and the use of data augmentation. The goal was to evaluate the effect of these parameters on the model's performance in terms of test accuracy.\n",

    "## **Analysis and Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimizer Choice**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **AdamW** consistently outperformed **Adam**, achieving higher accuracy across all experiments except Experiment 3. This suggests that **AdamW** might be more suitable for the current task, potentially due to its better handling of weight decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frozen Layers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Experiments with more unfreezed layers (3) did not consistently outperform experiments with fewer unfreezed layers. Experiment 5, which had only 1 layer unfreezed, achieved the highest accuracy (80.95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dropout**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The addition of dropout (0.5) in **Experiments 4 and 5** helped improve the model's performance compared to **Experiments 1, 2, and 3**. It appears that regularization through dropout enhances generalization without overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Temporal Augmentation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Experiment 6, which used temporal augmentation (Random Stride and Random Start Point), showed the lowest test accuracy (66.67%). The lack of improvement could suggest that temporal augmentation, at least with the current setup, may not be beneficial or may require more fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Experiment 5** shows the best test accuracy (80.95%) and suggests that a configuration with the **AdamW optimizer**, **1 unfreezed layer**, and **dropout = 0.5** is optimal for this dataset.\n",
    "* While **temporal augmentation** had no beneficial effect in **Experiment 6**, further experimentation with different augmentation strategies may still be worthwhile.\n",
    "* Future experiments could involve increasing the number of unfreezed layers and testing other augmentation methods to better generalize the model.\n",

    "## **Analysis and Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Effect of Temporal Augmentation (Experiment 7)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Experiment 7**, which included temporal augmentation (random stride, start point, and jitter), showed a significant drop in performance with a test accuracy of **66.67%**. The complex nature of the temporal augmentations may have made the model more prone to overfitting or noise, reducing its generalization ability on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Impact of Random Flip (Experiments 8 & 9)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Both **Experiment 8** (with a random flip probability of 0.5) and **Experiment 9** (with a higher probability of 0.7) resulted in a test accuracy of **71.43%**, showing no improvement with the increase in flip probability. This suggests that random flipping, at least at these probabilities, might not have had a significant impact on the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Epochs and Test Accuracy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Experiment 10**, which used 15 epochs and 2 unfreezed layers, achieved the best test accuracy of **76.19%**. Increasing the number of epochs and unfreezing more layers appears to benefit the model when compared to experiments with fewer epochs (like Experiments 11, 12, and 13).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dropout Variations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The dropout rate played a crucial role in regularizing the model. Experiment 11, which had a higher dropout rate of **0.6**, did not improve accuracy and actually resulted in a test accuracy of **71.43%**, the same as several other experiments. It seems that a **dropout rate of 0.5** (as seen in Experiments 8-10) might be more optimal for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Effect of Epochs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Experiment 13**, which used only 5 epochs, showed no increase in accuracy compared to those with 10 or 15 epochs, supporting the idea that a higher number of epochs could be beneficial for training.\n",

    "* **Experiment 10**, which used **2 unfreezed layers**, **dropout = 0.5**, and **15 epochs**, yielded the best performance with a **test accuracy of 76.19%**.\n",
    "* **Temporal augmentation** (Experiment 7) did not improve model performance and might have introduced more complexity without sufficient benefits.\n",
    "* **Random flip augmentation** had little effect on performance, suggesting that its use should be further tested with different configurations.\n",

    "* **Experiment 26** achieved the highest test accuracy of **80.95%**, likely due to the combination of **5 unfreezed layers**, **dropout = 0.8**, and a **moderate weight decay (0.05)**.\n",
    "* **Higher dropout values** (e.g., 0.7, 0.8) seem to harm the model's performance, with several experiments showing consistent accuracy of **66.67%**.\n",
    "* **Label smoothing** had a minimal impact on performance and may require fine-tuning to improve its effectiveness.\n",
